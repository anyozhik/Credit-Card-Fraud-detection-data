# Credit Card Fraud detection data
 This repository contains data and the code for making predictions based on this data.

The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. It contains information about transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. Due to confidential reasons features of each transaction are not shown in original way (they are transformed with PCA and called V1, V2, â€¦ V28), the only features that have not been changed are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Among these transactions there are some fraud ones.

Using this data, we are trying to make a model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
